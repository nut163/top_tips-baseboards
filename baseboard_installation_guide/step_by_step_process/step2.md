# Step 2: Measure and Cut the Baseboards

Before we start, make sure you have the following tools and materials:

- Tape Measure
- Miter Saw
- Safety Glasses
- Baseboard Material

## Process

1. **Measure the Wall:** Use your tape measure to measure the length of the wall where you will install the baseboard. Write down the measurement.

2. **Mark the Baseboard:** Transfer the measurement to your baseboard material. Make sure to mark the baseboard on the backside to avoid visible marks.

3. **Cut the Baseboard:** Using your miter saw, cut the baseboard at a 45-degree angle. Always remember to wear your safety glasses when cutting.

## Handy Tips

- Always measure twice before cutting. This will help you avoid mistakes and wasting material.
- When cutting, make sure the miter saw is at full speed before you start the cut. This will give you a cleaner cut.
