# Step 1: Gathering Your Tools and Materials

Before we start with the actual installation process, it's important to gather all the necessary tools and materials. Here's what you'll need for this step:

- Baseboards
- Measuring Tape
- Miter Saw
- Coping Saw
- Nail Gun
- Level
- Safety Glasses
- Pencil

## Procedure

1. **Measure the Room**: Use your measuring tape to measure the length of the wall where you'll be installing the baseboard. Write down the measurements.

2. **Mark the Baseboards**: Using the measurements you've taken, mark the baseboards for cutting. Remember to always measure twice and cut once!

3. **Cut the Baseboards**: Using your miter saw, cut the baseboards at a 45-degree angle. This will allow them to fit together neatly at the corners.

4. **Test the Fit**: Before you secure the baseboards, it's a good idea to test the fit. Hold them up to the wall and make sure they align properly.

5. **Secure the Baseboards**: Once you're satisfied with the fit, you can secure the baseboards to the wall using your nail gun. Make sure the baseboards are level before you nail them in place.

Remember, safety first! Always wear your safety glasses when cutting and nailing the baseboards.
