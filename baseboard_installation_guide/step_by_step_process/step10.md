# Step 10: Finishing Touches

## Materials Needed
- Paint
- Paintbrush
- Caulk
- Caulking gun

## Instructions

1. Once your baseboards are installed, you may notice some gaps between the wall and the baseboard or between different pieces of baseboard. These can be filled with caulk. Load your caulking gun with a tube of caulk and apply a thin bead along the gap. Smooth the caulk with your finger or a caulk smoothing tool.

2. After caulking, you can paint your baseboards if desired. Use a paintbrush to apply a thin, even coat of paint. Let the paint dry completely before applying a second coat if necessary.

3. Finally, clean up your workspace. Dispose of any leftover materials properly and store your tools for future use.

Congratulations! You have successfully installed your own baseboards.

## Handy Tips

- When painting, use painter's tape to protect the wall and floor from accidental paint splatters.
- If you're not sure what color to paint your baseboards, a common choice is to match them to the trim in the rest of your house.
- Always let paint dry completely before applying a second coat. This will help prevent streaks and drips.
