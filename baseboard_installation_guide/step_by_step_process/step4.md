# Step 4: Cutting the Baseboards

Before we start, make sure you have the following tools and materials:

- Miter Saw
- Tape Measure
- Pencil
- Safety Glasses

## Process

1. Measure the length of the wall where you will install the baseboard. Use your tape measure for this and make sure to record the measurement.

2. Mark the measurement on your baseboard with the pencil. This is where you will make your cut.

3. Set up your miter saw. Make sure to wear your safety glasses to protect your eyes from any flying debris.

4. Align the baseboard on the miter saw with the marked measurement lined up with the blade.

5. Make the cut. Remember to let the saw do the work and don't force it.

6. Repeat this process for all the baseboards you will be installing.

## Tips

- Always measure twice and cut once. This will help you avoid any mistakes.
- Make sure to cut the baseboards in a well-ventilated area to avoid inhaling any dust.
