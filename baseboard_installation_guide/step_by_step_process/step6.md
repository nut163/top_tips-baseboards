# Step 6: Installing the Baseboards

Before we start, make sure you have the following tools and materials:

- Baseboards
- Nail gun or hammer and nails
- Wood glue
- Level
- Measuring tape

## Instructions

1. **Measure and Cut the Baseboards**: Measure the length of the wall where you will install the baseboard. Cut the baseboard to the appropriate length.

2. **Apply Wood Glue**: Apply a thin layer of wood glue to the back of the baseboard.

3. **Position the Baseboard**: Position the baseboard against the wall. Use the level to ensure it is straight.

4. **Secure the Baseboard**: Use the nail gun or hammer and nails to secure the baseboard to the wall. Make sure to nail into the studs for a secure fit.

5. **Check Your Work**: Check that the baseboard is secure and level. Make any necessary adjustments.

## Tips

- Always measure twice before cutting.
- Use a miter saw for more precise cuts.
- If you're using a hammer and nails, consider using a nail set to drive the nails below the surface of the baseboard.
