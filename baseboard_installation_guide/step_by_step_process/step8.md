# Step 8: Installing the Baseboards

Before we start, make sure you have the following tools and materials:

- Baseboards
- Nail gun or hammer and nails
- Wood glue
- Level
- Measuring tape

## Step 8.1: Measure and Cut the Baseboards

Measure the length of the wall where you will install the baseboard. Cut the baseboard to the appropriate length using a miter saw. Remember to cut the ends at a 45-degree angle if they will meet with another piece of baseboard at a corner.

## Step 8.2: Apply Wood Glue

Apply a thin line of wood glue to the back of the baseboard. This will help secure the baseboard to the wall.

## Step 8.3: Position the Baseboard

Position the baseboard against the wall. Use a level to ensure it is straight.

## Step 8.4: Secure the Baseboard

Use a nail gun or hammer and nails to secure the baseboard to the wall. Nail at an angle to ensure the nails go into the wall studs.

## Step 8.5: Repeat for Remaining Walls

Repeat this process for all remaining walls.

## Handy Tip

If you're having trouble getting the baseboard to stick to the wall, try using a rubber mallet to gently tap it into place.
