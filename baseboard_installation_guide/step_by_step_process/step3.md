# Step 3: Measure and Cut the Baseboards

Before we start, make sure you have the following tools and materials:

- Tape Measure
- Miter Saw
- Safety Glasses
- Baseboard Material

## Instructions

1. **Measure the Wall:** Use your tape measure to determine the length of the wall where you will install the baseboard. Write down the measurement.

2. **Mark the Baseboard:** Transfer the measurement to your baseboard material. Make sure to mark the baseboard on the backside to avoid visible marks.

3. **Cut the Baseboard:** Using your miter saw, cut the baseboard at the mark. Remember to wear your safety glasses while cutting.

## Handy Tips

- Always measure twice before cutting. This will help you avoid mistakes and save material.
- When marking the baseboard, use a pencil for easy erasing.
- If you're new to using a miter saw, practice on some scrap material first.
