# Step 9: Installing the Baseboards

Before we start, make sure you have the following tools and materials:

- Baseboards
- Nail gun or hammer and nails
- Wood glue
- Level
- Measuring tape

## Step 9.1: Measure and Cut the Baseboards

Measure the length of the wall where you will install the baseboard. Cut the baseboard to the appropriate length using a miter saw. Remember to cut the ends at a 45-degree angle if they will be meeting another piece of baseboard at a corner.

## Step 9.2: Apply Wood Glue

Apply a thin line of wood glue to the back of the baseboard. This will help secure the baseboard to the wall.

## Step 9.3: Position the Baseboard

Position the baseboard against the wall. Use a level to ensure it is straight.

## Step 9.4: Secure the Baseboard

Using a nail gun or hammer and nails, secure the baseboard to the wall. Make sure to nail into the wall studs for the best hold.

## Step 9.5: Repeat

Repeat these steps for each wall in your room.
