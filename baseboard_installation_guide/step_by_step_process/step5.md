# Step 5: Cutting the Baseboards

Before we start, make sure you have the following tools and materials:

- Miter Saw
- Safety Glasses
- Tape Measure
- Pencil

## Process

1. Measure the length of the wall where you will install the baseboard. Use your tape measure for this and note down the measurement.

2. Mark the measurement on your baseboard with the pencil. Make sure to mark on the back of the baseboard to avoid visible marks.

3. Set up your miter saw. Ensure you have your safety glasses on to protect your eyes from any flying debris.

4. Align the baseboard on the miter saw with the marked measurement lined up with the saw blade.

5. Cut the baseboard. Make sure to hold the baseboard steady as you cut to ensure a clean, straight cut.

## Handy Tips

- Always measure twice before cutting. This will help avoid any mistakes.
- When cutting, let the saw do the work. Don't force it through the material.
