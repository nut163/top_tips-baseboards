# Step 7: Installing the Baseboards

Before we start, make sure you have the following materials ready:

- Baseboards
- Nail gun or hammer and nails
- Wood glue
- Level

## Instructions

1. Apply a thin line of wood glue to the back of your baseboard. This will help secure it to the wall.

2. Position the baseboard against the wall. Make sure the bottom edge is resting on the floor.

3. Use your level to ensure the baseboard is straight. Adjust as necessary.

4. Once the baseboard is in the correct position, secure it to the wall using your nail gun or hammer and nails. Make sure to nail into the studs you marked earlier.

5. Repeat this process for all baseboards.

## Tips

- If you're using a nail gun, be careful not to set the pressure too high. This could cause the baseboard to crack.

- If you're using a hammer and nails, consider using a nail set to drive the nails slightly below the surface of the baseboard. This will give a cleaner finish.
