# Tools and Materials for Baseboard Installation

Before you start with the baseboard installation process, it's important to gather all the necessary tools and materials. Here's a comprehensive list:

## Tools

1. **Tape Measure**: To measure the length of the walls where the baseboards will be installed.
2. **Miter Saw**: To cut the baseboards at the correct angle.
3. **Coping Saw**: To cut the inside corners of the baseboards.
4. **Nail Gun**: To secure the baseboards to the walls.
5. **Level**: To ensure the baseboards are installed straight.
6. **Hammer**: To tap the baseboards into place.
7. **Pry Bar**: To remove any existing baseboards.

## Materials

1. **Baseboards**: Choose a style and material that matches your room. The quantity will depend on the perimeter of your room.
2. **Nails**: You'll need nails that are long enough to go through the baseboard and into the wall.
3. **Caulk**: To fill in any gaps between the baseboard and the wall.
4. **Paint**: If your baseboards aren't pre-painted, you'll need paint and a paintbrush.

Remember, safety first! Always wear protective gear when using tools, especially power tools.
