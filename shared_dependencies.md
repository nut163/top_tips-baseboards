Given the nature of the files, which are mostly markdown (.md) files for a GitHub repository, there are no explicit shared dependencies such as exported variables, data schemas, id names of DOM elements, message names, or function names. 

However, there are implicit shared dependencies in terms of content and structure:

1. "Content Structure": All files will follow a similar markdown structure for headers, subheaders, lists, links, and images.

2. "Navigation Links": There will be shared navigation links between the files. For example, the README.md file will contain links to all other files, and each step file might contain a link to the next step and the previous step.

3. "Consistent Terminology": All files will use a consistent set of terms and definitions to describe the process of installing baseboards.

4. "Shared Images or Diagrams": If there are any images or diagrams used to illustrate the process, these could be considered shared resources.

5. "Shared References": If there are any references to external resources, these could be considered shared dependencies.

6. "Shared Style Guide": All files will follow a shared style guide for writing and formatting content.
